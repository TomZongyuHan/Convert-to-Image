## Background
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning architectures that have shown promising results and gained widespread attention concerning image data. CNN takes an input image (e.g., p × q feature matrix) and through its hidden layers conducts feature extraction and classification. One of the key advantages of CNN is their high efficiency, i.e. fewer samples and less training time are needed to achieve good levels of performance. This led to their high popularity in a myriad of cutting-edge commercial applications. As input, CNN takes an image. In a local region, an image is comprised of spatially coherent pixels, i.e., similar information is shared by the pixels near each other. If pixels are arbitrarily arranged, then their placement can negatively impact the performance of the feature extraction and classification process. Consequently, the order of the nearby pixels of an image in CNN is not independent. Thus, converting non image data to image data considering spatially coherent pixels in local regions plays an important role in the non-image data transformation. Hence, the transformation helps to improve the resolution of cell types in the single cell data.
